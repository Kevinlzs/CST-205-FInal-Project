To run the program you need first need to have Python 3.7+ and we recommend to use a 
virtual enviornment. In your activated virtual enviornment, first install pip,
pip install --upgrade pip. Next install pillow, pip install Pillow. Then install 
QT for python by typing this command in the terminal, pip install PySide6. Lastly, 
you should install requests using this command, pip install requests. Once those 
are all install then you can type python3 (or your current version of python) qt.py
to run the program.
